# Causal effect of Exclusive Breastfeeding over Chronic illness

## Overview
Breastfeeding provides unsurpassed natural nutrition to the newborn and infant. 
Human breast milk also contains numerous protective factors against infectious disease and may influence immune system development. 
If immune system development is significantly improved with the introduction of components of breast milk, 
then prematurely discontinued breastfeeding may facilitate pathogenesis of many chronic diseases later in life.
This article examines the hypothesis that breastfeeding may have long-term protective effects against chronic disease in children. 
Alternatively, artificial feeding, or the absence of breastfeeding, may increase the risk for chronic disease.
The literature reporting investigations of the association between infant feeding practices and chronic disease has expanded dramatically since 1984 
when Borch-Johnsen and colleagues reported that the risk of type I diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), 
was higher among children who were not breastfed for at least 3 months. 
In addition, other studies have considered whether artificial feeding increases the risk for celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, childhood cancer, obesity and more.
In our research, we will try to estimate the casual effect of exclusive breastfeeding over chronic diseases (any) in children, using data from national health survey in India.
